# IPO Email Alerts

The market is ripe for a season of fresh IPOs, and I didn't want to miss out; so I built IPO Email Alerts to notify me at the right time with the right information when a fresh IPO hits the market.

## Getting Started

Head over to the production site [IPOEmailAlerts.com](http://ipoemailalerts.com) and input your email address to get on the list.

## How It's Made

IPO Email Alerts is built with Next.js, and is hosted in Vercel.

It uses a NodeJS backend, querying a couple of super secret APIs, processing a bunch of information on a schedule to get you the stuff you need.

## Usage

This is a fresh project, and because I haven't hit any quotas yet, it's totally free! Sign up and get your valuable and timely data without even seeing the word credit card.
